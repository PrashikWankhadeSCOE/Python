for i in range(1,5):
    print(i)

# here 1 is the starting index and 5 is the ending index
# and by default the step is +1 so i will increase from 1 to 5 
# and will not include 5
# output 
# 1 2 3 4 

for i in range(5,1):
    print(i)

# it wont give any output 

for i in range(1,10,2):
    print(i)

# it will inrease the value of i by 2 as the step we gave is 2

for i in range(10,1,-1):
    print(i)

# to reverse from 10 to 1 and add a step of -1 which will reverse it as step is -1
